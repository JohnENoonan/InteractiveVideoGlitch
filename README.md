# Interactive Video Glitch
Program to interactively "glitch" or edit a video using openFrameworks. Given a video it will play back based the input from the GUI (currently video and window dimension are hard coded). As of now the program implements various forms of pixel sorting and 1 color changing algorithm.  

## Inspiration
To make a tool to glitch (or more accurately create "destructive" edits) a given video and explore interesting algorithms that could be used.

## Issues
Currently there are problems with playback speed beyond just having overly expensive calculations per frame. I'll try and address these soon, but I may have to move on. An end goal of doing this project is to make a standalone application to create art directed "glitched" images and videos that will export rendered images and videos.
